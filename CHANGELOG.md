## [Unreleased]

### Qwen3-Omni thinker speech-language export

#### Added

- `qwen3_omni_moe` now builds the Qwen3-Omni thinker as a `speech-language`
  package (`audio_encoder` / `embedding` / `decoder`): the Qwen3-ASR audio
  encoder, audio-token feature fusion, and a QK-norm MoE decoder with
  interleaved MRoPE. The vision tower, talker, and code2wav are not exported.
- Routed experts emit one `com.microsoft::MoE` node per layer on EPs that
  support it, with expert-major weights stacked at export time. The portable
  loop-over-experts graph (three initializers and a GEMM per expert per layer)
  remains the fallback; for the 30B checkpoint it made ONNX Runtime spend ~20
  minutes of session initialisation on 18k expert tensors.
- Olive-layout checkpoints with symmetric int8 routed experts export through
  `com.microsoft::QMoE` (`expert_weight_bits=8`). When
  `quantization_config.modules_to_not_convert` lists every layer's
  `self_attn`, attention keeps float projections, so expert-only int8
  checkpoints (e.g. int8 experts with bf16 everything else) load unchanged.
- `supported_qmoe_quantization` accepts symmetric int8 in addition to int4.
  Asymmetric int8 still falls back, as its zero-point layout is unvalidated.
- `--features static-cache` now applies to speech-language models (Qwen3-ASR,
  Qwen3-Omni): the decoder takes pre-allocated `key_cache.{i}` /
  `value_cache.{i}` buffers with `write_indices` and `nonpad_kv_seqlen`
  instead of growing `past_key_values` and `attention_mask`, so single-token
  decode steps have fixed shapes and can be replayed from a CUDA graph.

#### Fixed

- Composite configs that carry both `thinker_config` and `talker_config`
  (Qwen3-Omni) resolve to the thinker text config instead of the talker.

### GPT-OSS MXFP4 export

#### Added

- GPT-OSS MXFP4 checkpoints now preserve their native block/scales storage by
  default through bounded safetensors streaming. `--model` and local
  `--config` builds use the same CUDA f16/bf16 contract and transactional
  package publication.
- `--dequantize` explicitly selects the portable dense GPT-OSS graph. Dense
  MXFP4 reconstruction eagerly loads and converts the checkpoint and can
  require substantial host memory; native streaming remains the default.

### Independent quantization for multi-component packages

#### Added

- HuggingFace composite checkpoints can declare a `component_quantization`
  mapping (or `quantization_config.components`) whose keys match
  `ModelPackage` component names such as `decoder`, `encoder`,
  `vision_encoder`, `audio_encoder`, and `embedding`. Nested
  `vision_config.quantization_config` and `audio_config.quantization_config`
  values are also recognized.
- `build_from_module` now configures every component independently. Existing
  quantized decoder modules are retargeted to the component's bit width and
  group size, float encoder/vision/audio projections are converted to
  `MatMulNBits`, quantized embeddings use `GatherBlockQuantized`, and components
  omitted from the mapping remain floating point.
- Olive mixed-precision component-wide `modules_to_not_convert` and `overrides`
  are collapsed into component layouts. Partial module rules and genuinely
  mixed layouts inside one ONNX component fail with an actionable error instead
  of loading packed weights with the wrong configuration.

### Packed fused MoE experts (Olive/GPTQ/AWQ) survive HF weight renaming

#### Fixed

- MoE exports whose routed experts go through the fused `com.microsoft::QMoE`
  packer (`qwen3_moe`, Mixtral, OLMoE, Qwen2-MoE, Ernie4.5-MoE, GLM4-MoE) no
  longer fail on **packed quantized** fused expert tensors.
  `_rename_moe_expert_weights` matched packed sidecars by substring
  (`.experts.gate_up_proj` also matches `experts.gate_up_proj_qweight`) and
  split them as if they were float weights, writing the `qweight`, `scales` and
  `qzeros` of one projection to the *same* per-expert `.weight` key — so only
  the last one survived, and the restacked tensor no longer matched the QMoE
  parameter, aborting the export at weight binding:

  ```
  ValueError: Weight shape mismatch for 'model.layers.0.mlp.fc1_experts_weights':
  model expects [4, 64, 32], got [4, 256]
  ```

  Packed tensors now pass through untouched and reach
  `pack_qmoe_expert_weights` in the expert-major layout it expects (Qwen3-MoE
  Olive int4: `[128, 1536, 1024]` uint8 weights + `[128, 1536, 16]` bf16
  scales). Unquantized fused experts still un-fuse into the dense per-expert
  fallback.

#### Added

- `mobius._weight_utils.is_packed_quant_key` plus the shared
  `OLIVE_PACKED_QUANT_SUFFIXES` / `DOTTED_PACKED_QUANT_SUFFIXES` /
  `PACKED_QUANT_SUFFIXES` constants: one predicate for
  `_qweight`/`_scales`/`_qzeros` (Olive) and `.qweight`/`.scales`/`.qzeros`
  (GPTQ/AWQ) sidecar keys, reused by `preprocess_quantized_weights`.

---

### Qwen3-MoE packages load in ONNX Runtime GenAI

#### Fixed

- Exported `qwen3_moe` packages no longer fail to load with
  `RuntimeError: Unsupported model_type in config.json: qwen3_moe`.
  `_ORT_GENAI_MODEL_TYPE` had no `qwen3_moe` entry, so `--config` mode wrote
  the HuggingFace type straight into `genai_config.json` and ORT GenAI
  rejected it (its LLM type registry has no `qwen3_moe`). Qwen3-MoE now
  resolves to the accepted `qwen3` type: both `qwen2` and `qwen3` dispatch to
  ORT GenAI's `DecoderOnly_Model`, but its tokenizer tag fallback
  (`tokenizer_tag_utils.cpp`) only supplies the Qwen3 reasoning-token IDs
  (`bor` 151667 / `eor` 151668) for `qwen3` — under `qwen2` they are absent and
  `tokenizer.bor_token_id` / `eor_token_id` throws. The pre-existing dense
  `qwen3 -> qwen2` alias is unchanged.

---

### Fixed

- An exported graph is no longer transcribed into its own workflow component.
  A component backed by a shipped `.onnx` file now declares only `ports.roles`;
  the artifact answers every question about which ports exist and what shape
  they have, and the runtime resolves them against the live session. The
  removed block was a second statement of the same ABI with nothing keeping the
  two in agreement — the same defect as `model.io`, one level down. Package
  validation and runtime conformance both stay at 11/11 against the pinned ONNX
  GenAI branch, and the contract tests now resolve every role, invocation
  binding and state pair against the graph itself rather than against the
  metadata's agreement with a copy of itself, which is a strictly stronger
  check.

  Policy graphs keep their contracts, and that boundary was measured rather
  than assumed: a workflow value inherits its dtype, rank and request axis from
  the port that produced it, so dropping them left row-wise emits untyped and
  made 4 of the 11 packages invalid. Those contracts type the workflow's own
  dataflow; they do not describe an external interface.

- Deep decoders are now covered where the cache layer annotation actually
  matters. Every metadata package built in the test suite had two layers, and
  below ten a cell label sorts identically whether ordered lexicographically,
  numerically or by insertion — so a `layer` derived from a cell's position
  rather than parsed from its port name would have passed every assertion while
  transposing caches on any real model. `canonical_workflow_contract_test` now
  builds twelve-layer dynamic, static-cache and hybrid decoders and pins that
  the declared layer restates the port name, that ordering by it recovers the
  buffer lists, and that a hybrid's alternating groups own layers their cells'
  positions never equal. A producer that dropped the parse leaves the 101
  pre-existing assertions green and fails seven of these.

- Every component a task builds now declares an optimization role. Qwen3-TTS's
  four loop-wiring graphs (`code_predictor_prefill`,
  `code_predictor_step_embedder`, `code_predictor_indices`, `talker_text_step`)
  were absent from `TTSTask.model_roles`, so `build_from_module` fell back to
  the `"decoder"` role and offered them the GQA / QKV-packing passes meant for
  attention stacks, and `inspect_components` under-reported the package by four
  components. They now declare a `"glue"` role: a parameter-free graph that
  reads every tensor it uses from a graph input. `arch_validation_test` fails
  any task that builds a component it does not declare, and a network-free unit
  test pins the same invariant for Qwen3-TTS.

### One canonical serialized representation

#### Changed

- **`pipeline.workflow` is now the only place a package describes its graph
  ABI.** No export emits `model.io`, including a bare single-file decoder: that
  case is a one-component workflow, not a different kind of document. `model`
  keeps package-wide geometry and capabilities and nothing else. Two writable
  statements of one fact are a defect whatever they contain — nothing forces
  them to agree, and a reader of either never learns the other exists — so a
  runtime that wants an optimized single-graph path derives it by lowering the
  workflow instead. Verified end to end: the ONNX GenAI runtime executes the
  fixed-capacity decode path from the workflow alone, with no `model.io` in the
  package.

#### Added

- An ONNX component that ships an artifact declares no port contracts. The
  `.onnx` file travels inside the package and is authoritative for which ports
  exist and what each one's dtype, rank and shape is, so transcribing that into
  YAML would be a second writable statement of one fact — the very thing this
  section removes — sitting one level below `model.io` rather than beside it.
  The runtime resolves ports against the live session, which catches a name the
  graph does not expose instead of agreeing with a stale echo of it. A
  producer-synthesized policy graph is the exception and states its contracts,
  because a workflow value takes its dtype, rank and request axis from the port
  that produced it: those contracts are the dataflow's type annotations, not a
  description of an external interface.
- Every ONNX component declares `ports.roles`: what it *does* with a value bound
  to a port. An invocation records which SSA value reaches a port, not whether
  that port is tokens, a mask or logits. Mobius mints these port names in its own
  task builders, so it states the mapping (`input_ids`→`token_ids`,
  `inputs_embeds`, `attention_mask`, `position_ids`, `logits`,
  `last_hidden_state`→`hidden_states`, `encoder_hidden_states`,
  `audio_features`) rather than inferring it. A port outside that vocabulary
  carries no role.
- State port aliases declare `role` (`key`/`value`) and `layer`. A layer's key
  and value buffers are the same dtype and shape, and a cell's label sorts
  lexicographically so `cache_10` precedes `cache_2` — pairing per-layer buffers
  positionally would silently transpose two layers' caches. Both fields are
  emitted together or not at all, so a recurrent or convolution cache is never
  given a fabricated index.
- `IndexedScatter.kv_length_ports` names the port carrying the graph-visible
  valid length, beside the existing `write_indices_ports`. The two control
  vectors are both rank-1 integers and are therefore indistinguishable by shape;
  with both named, the whole fixed-capacity ABI is recoverable from the workflow.
- `tests/canonical_workflow_contract_test.py` pins the invariant. It asks one
  set of shape-agnostic questions of dynamic, static-cache, FP8, heterogeneous
  and composite packages — and of all 11 checked-in fixtures — so a future
  feature cannot grow its own top-level block while every feature-specific test
  keeps passing.

### Fixed-capacity (static) KV cache and FP8 KV cache metadata

#### Added

- `--features static-cache` now produces onnx-genai metadata instead of being
  refused. The producer publishes the write cursor (`write_indices`), the valid
  length (`nonpad_kv_seqlen`), the fixed-capacity buffer contracts, the
  per-layer input/output pairs, and an `indexed_scatter` state-service update
  discipline naming the cursor, the capacity and the per-component port that
  carries it. The buffers are declared as `recurrence: {kind: invariant}` loop
  cells and the capacity as a `package.cache_capacity` literal workflow input.
  Nothing dispatches on model name; the ports are read from the graph.
- Heterogeneous caches keep their own disciplines. Gemma 4's sliding layers stay
  on a growing rank-4 BNSH cache while its full-attention layers use rank-3
  fixed-capacity buffers, and only the layers that own a buffer bind ports in a
  state group — its KV-shared suffix owns none.
- A `static_cache` package joined the checked-in onnx-genai conformance
  fixtures, so the engine exercises the fixed-capacity carry and the write
  cursor rather than only the growing-tensor path.

#### Fixed

- Gemma 4's shared-KV fallback pinned a 4-D BNSH shape onto *any* borrowed KV
  tensor whose rank was not 4. A static-cache source hands over a fully known
  rank-3 `[batch, capacity, kv_hidden]` buffer, so this overwrote a correct
  shape with a wrong one — corrupting the declared shape of
  `updated_key_cache.N` and defeating the rank-3 static-source test further
  down, which would then have transposed a rank-3 tensor as BNSH. The fallback
  now only supplies a shape when there is none.
- Gemma 4's vision-language decoder dropped `attention_mask` whenever the export
  was static, but a Gemma 4 decoder is only *partly* static: its sliding layers
  keep a dynamic cache and build their bias from that mask. The hybrid decoder
  therefore lost all padding information. Both builders now apply one rule — a
  mask exists exactly when some layer still has a dynamic cache — so a fully
  static decoder carries no unused port and a hybrid one keeps its mask.
- `--features fp8-kv-cache` no longer silently produces a float16 cache. The
  gate only tested whether GQA fusion was *expected*; the pass now reports how
  many caches it converted and the build fails when the answer is zero, naming
  the reason: FP8 KV storage needs an attention operator with `k_scale`/
  `v_scale` inputs, which a `TensorScatter` + `ai.onnx` `Attention` static-cache
  graph does not have.


### Qwen3.5/3.6-MoE mixed float/quantized decoder (Olive checkpoints)

#### Fixed

- **Olive-quantized** Qwen3.5/3.6-**MoE** exports (text and VL) no longer
  quantize the modules that Olive's quantization walk skips:
  - `linear_attn` (GatedDeltaNet) projections now use plain `Linear`.
  - `shared_expert_gate` (the `[1, hidden]` sigmoid gate of `Qwen35MoEBlock`)
    now uses plain `Linear`.

  Olive's `ModelWrapper` excludes `linear_attn` for the `qwen3_5_moe` /
  `qwen3_5_moe_text` model types (`MAMBA` table) and every
  `shared_expert_gate` (`SHARED_EXPERT_GATE` table) from quantization since
  microsoft/Olive#2630, so those checkpoints never contain the packed
  `MatMulNBits` initializers the previous graph expected (e.g.
  `linear_attn.in_proj_qkv.weight` as `[48, 2, 8]` uint8 + scales). Ordinary
  self-attention, the shared-expert MLP, the dense MLP and the fused
  `com.microsoft::QMoE` experts remain quantized; router `gate` behavior is
  unchanged.

  Scope is deliberately narrow:
  - **Dense** Qwen3.5/3.6 (`Qwen35CausalLMModel` and its VL split) is *not* in
    Olive's `MAMBA` table, so its `linear_attn` stays quantized.
  - Other checkpoint formats retain their previous graph construction; this
    change only aligns Mobius with Olive's module selection.

- Qwen3.6 VL exports now emit the packed Qwen image-processing pipeline when
  the composite build exposes its unwrapped `qwen3_5_moe_text` config. This
  adds the required `PatchImage` transform so `pixel_values` matches the
  vision encoder's rank-2 packed-patch input.

#### Added

- `Qwen2MoELayer(..., shared_expert_gate_class=...)` to override the linear
  factory for `shared_expert_gate` only (`None` falls back to `linear_class`,
  so existing callers are unaffected).

---

### NVIDIA Cosmos 3 Edge vision-language model (`cosmos3_edge`)

#### Added

- Support for the **full `cosmos3_edge` vision-language model**
  (`nvidia/Cosmos3-Edge`, `Cosmos3EdgeForConditionalGeneration`) as a 3-model
  onnxruntime-genai split (`decoder` + `vision_encoder` + `embedding`):
  - **decoder**: grouped-query-attention text reasoner with a **non-gated
    squared-ReLU FFN** (`hidden_act="relu2"`, `up_proj → relu2 → down_proj`)
    and 3D multimodal RoPE (`mrope_section=[24, 20, 20]`); takes
    `inputs_embeds`.
  - **vision_encoder**: SigLIP vision tower + a new
    `Cosmos3EdgeMultiModalProjector` (pre-shuffle `LayerNorm` → 2×2
    pixel-shuffle → `linear_fc1` → GELU → `linear_fc2`).
  - **embedding**: token embedding + image-feature fusion at
    `image_token_id=19`.
  `preprocess_weights` routes the single HF checkpoint to the three
  sub-models: `model.visual.*` / `model.projector.*` → vision (with SigLIP
  `mlp.fc1/fc2` → `up_proj/down_proj`), `embed_tokens` → embedding, the
  top-level text tower (`layers.*` / `norm` / `lm_head`) → decoder (renaming
  `self_attn.to_{q,k,v,out}` → `{q,k,v,o}_proj`), and drops the
  generator-tower `k_norm_und_for_gen` key-norm. Built via a new
  `Cosmos3EdgeVLTask` (`cosmos3-edge-vl`). The decoder-only text reasoner
  remains available as `cosmos3_edge_text`.
- **L1 graph-build tested only.** NVIDIA does not publish modeling code for
  `cosmos3_edge` (not in `transformers`, no remote-code module), so the exact
  pixel-shuffle ordering and numerical parity are unverifiable; L4/L5 parity
  is deferred. The `cosmos3_omni` variants (`Cosmos3-Nano`/`-Super`) are
  two-tower diffusion world models tracked separately.

### Cargo-style `--features` build option

#### Added

- `mobius build --features <a,b,...>` collects the build-mode toggles under a
  single Rust/cargo-style option. Accepts a comma-separated list and may be
  repeated (`--features fp8-kv-cache,static-cache` or `--features fp8-kv-cache
  --features static-cache`). Available features: `static-cache`, `fp8-kv-cache`,
  `prune-prefill-prefix`, `text-only`. Unknown feature names are rejected with an error
  listing the valid set.

#### Changed

- The boolean flags `--static-cache`, `--fp8-kv-cache`, and `--text-only` have
  been **removed** in favor of the equivalent `--features` value. Companion
  value args (`--max-seq-len`, `--kv-cache-scale-file`) are unchanged.

### Prefill token-prefix pruning (`--features prune-prefill-prefix`)

#### Added

- `build(prune_prefill_prefix=True)` and
  `mobius build --features prune-prefill-prefix` discard prefill token positions
  before the final token after required KV states have been produced. Generic
  causal models prune immediately before the LM head; Gemma 4 also prunes its
  KV-sharing layer suffix and per-layer inputs.

### FP8 (E4M3) KV-cache export (`--features fp8-kv-cache`)

#### Added

- `build(fp8_kv_cache=True)` and `mobius build --features fp8-kv-cache` retype the
  fused `GroupQueryAttention` KV cache to `FLOAT8E4M3FN` (per-tensor E4M3) after
  GQA fusion, adding `k_scale`/`v_scale` initializers and the
  `k_quant_type`/`v_quant_type="PER_TENSOR"`, `kv_cache_bit_width=8` attributes.
  Halves KV-cache memory at long context on ORT runtimes with the FP8 KV kernel
  (SM89+). `--kv-cache-scale-file` supplies calibrated per-layer scales
  (onnxruntime-genai format); without it all layers use a unit scale of 1.0.
  Only graph-input or empty-placeholder caches are retyped — a non-empty
  initializer cache is skipped with a warning.

### Text-only export for multimodal Gemma 4 (`--features text-only`)

#### Added

- `build(text_only=True)` and `mobius build --features text-only` export the
  **text backbone** of a unified multimodal checkpoint as a standalone
  decoder-only LLM. For `gemma4_unified` (`google/gemma-4-12B`) this remaps the
  model type to its text sibling (`gemma4_unified_text`) and strips the
  vision/audio config so the decoder fuses to `GroupQueryAttention` on
  GQA-capable execution providers (CUDA/DML) instead of the float-bias
  `Attention` path forced by the multimodal bidirectional vision-block overlay.
  The `text-only` feature is rejected with `--config` / `--component` and now
  also bypasses diffusers autodetect so `build()` validation runs (a
  diffusers/unsupported repo raises instead of silently exporting a pipeline).

#### Changed

- `auto_export(..., ep="cuda"|"dml")` now forwards the execution provider to
  `build()` (`ep` → `build_ep`), so exports build the **EP-fused** graph
  (GQA / packed-QKV) rather than the portable `"default"` graph. Callers that
  relied on `auto_export` always producing a portable graph should pass
  `ep="cpu"` (which maps to the `"default"` build EP).

---

### KV-cache present-shape: fail-closed on partial parameter sets

#### Fixed

- `_register_kv_cache_outputs` now **raises `ValueError`** when given a partial
  set of present-shape parameters (1–5 of the six `batch`, `num_kv_heads`,
  `key_head_dim`, `value_head_dim`, `total_seq_len`, `dtype`) instead of logging
  a warning and proceeding. A partial set is always a wiring slip with no
  legitimate use; the previous fail-open shipped a structurally-wrong model
  (mis-derived `GroupQueryAttention` present `head_dim`) with only a log line.
  Passing all six (stamp) or none (infer) is unaffected. (closes #341)

---

### fp16 GQA Export Fix

#### Fixed

- Native fp16 GroupQueryAttention exports (e.g. `microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct`
  with `--dtype f16 --execution-provider cuda`) no longer emit fp32 packed-QKV /
  transposed weights. Previously the fold passes (`FoldConcatInitializersPass`,
  `FoldTransposedInitializerPass`) defaulted a folded initializer's dtype to
  `FLOAT` when the source `Value`'s declared type had been dropped during fp16
  casting, producing a model onnxruntime rejected at load with a
  `MatMul` type-parameter error (`tensor(float16)` vs `tensor(float)`) on both
  CPU and CUDA EPs. A new `mobius._passes._dtype_utils.initializer_dtype()`
  helper now resolves the effective dtype from `const_value` when the type
  annotation is missing, so fp16 GQA models load directly with no manual
  post-cast.

---

### GQA Present KV-Cache Shape Fix

#### Fixed

- GroupQueryAttention exports now declare correct `present.{i}.key` /
  `present.{i}.value` graph-output shapes and dtype. The GQA contrib op's shape
  inference mis-derived the present KV `head_dim` (e.g. 32 instead of 96 on
  `microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct`), so the present KV-cache outputs declared a
  `head_dim` inconsistent with the (correct) `past_key_values` inputs. ORT logged
  `Error merging shape info ... lenient merge` (64 warnings on Phi-3.5) and any
  consumer that chains `present` → `past` and trusts declared shapes (e.g.
  `onnxruntime-genai`) saw mismatched past-vs-present KV cache types. This is a
  metadata / declared-shape correction only — runtime numerics are unchanged
  (weights byte-identical, next-token parity 20/20). `_register_kv_cache_outputs`
  now stamps the present KV outputs symmetric to the past inputs. Affects
  GQA-fusion packed-QKV exports (Phi-3.5, Llama-3.2, Qwen2, Mistral, Phi-3-GQA).

---

### WebGPU Shape Op Support

#### Changed

- WebGPU now supports the ONNX `Shape` operator natively. The `EliminateShape`
  rewrite pass (which replaced `Shape(attention_mask)` with `ReduceSum` +
  `ReduceMax`) has been removed.

#### Removed

- **Breaking**: `EpCapabilities.supports_shape` field removed. Custom EPs that
  passed `supports_shape=True` or `supports_shape=False` to `EpCapabilities(...)`
  will get a `TypeError`. Remove the argument — `Shape` is now universally
  supported across all EPs.
- `mobius.rewrite_rules.eliminate_shape_rules` removed from the public API.

---

### Qwen3.6-27B Support

#### Added

- Qwen3.6-27B is now supported via the existing `qwen3_5` model type
  (`Qwen35VL3ModelCausalLMModel`). Qwen3.6 uses the same architecture as
  Qwen3.5 with `tie_word_embeddings=false` and larger dimensions (64
  layers, 5120 hidden size). No code changes required — fully config-driven.

### Mistral-3 / Pixtral VLM Support

#### Added

- Support for Mistral-3 / Pixtral vision-language models (`mistral3` model type)
  - Pixtral vision encoder with 2D RoPE, bidirectional attention, and spatial patch merging
  - `Mistral3MultiModalProjector` for vision-to-text projection (RMSNorm → merge → MLP)
  - `PixtralVisionTower` with precomputed 2D rotary caches
  - Moved `mistral3` from CausalLM to VLM (LLaVA-style 3-model split: decoder, vision, embedding)
  - FP8 quantization config handling (skip block quantization for fp8)
  - Integration tests for `ministral3` (text-only) and `mistral3` (VLM)
  - Config extraction for `PixtralVisionConfig.norm_eps` and `rope_parameters` fallback

### Static Cache Support

#### Added

- **Static KV cache in CLI and Python API** — `--static-cache` and
  `--max-seq-len` CLI flags for `mobius build`. Python API:
  `CausalLMTask(static_cache=True, max_seq_len=2048)`.  Static cache
  pre-allocates fixed-size KV buffers updated via TensorScatter, avoiding
  repeated concatenation (dynamic cache remains the default).
- `examples/static_cache_generation.py` — greedy text generation example
  with static KV cache, demonstrating `write_indices` and
  `nonpad_kv_seqlen` management.

#### Changed

- `CausalLMTask` now supports both dynamic and static cache modes via
  `static_cache` and `max_seq_len` keyword arguments.  The `build()`
  method uses clean conditionals for cache setup and output registration.

#### Removed

- `StaticCacheCausalLMTask` — use `CausalLMTask(static_cache=True,
  max_seq_len=...)` instead.  The `'static-cache-text-generation'` task
  registry entry has also been removed.

### Wave 9

#### Added

- `PostGatedRMSNorm` component for Qwen3.5 DeltaNet — gate-after-norm
  variant (`RMSNorm(x) * SiLU(gate)`) separate from Mamba2's
  gate-before-norm `GatedRMSNorm`.
- `merge_lora_weights()` in weight utils — merges PEFT LoRA adapters
  (`*.lora_A.weight` / `*.lora_B.weight`) into base weights at load time.
- Vision encoder integration tests (ViT + CLIP) with HF parity.
- KeyError guard for missing qweight in GPTQ/AWQ preprocessors —
  raises `ValueError` with context instead of raw `KeyError`.
- GGUF support proposal document (`docs/design/gguf-support-proposal.md`).

#### Fixed

- AWQ zero-point offset: per-nibble subtraction for 4-bit quantization.
  Byte-level `0x88 - 1 = 0x87` was wrong; now unpacks nibbles first
  to get correct `0x77`.
- CLIP class embedding `Unsqueeze` axes `[0,0]` → `[0,1]`.

### Wave 10 — GGUF Import

#### Added

- GGUF import pipeline (`build_from_gguf()`) — converts `.gguf` model
  files to ONNX via the standard build pipeline. Phase 1 dequantizes
  all tensors to float; Phase 2 will preserve quantization.
- `GGUFModel` reader wrapping `gguf.GGUFReader` with typed metadata
  parsing, lazy tensor iteration, and O(1) tensor lookup.
- `gguf_to_config()` mapping GGUF metadata → `ArchitectureConfig` with
  architecture-specific key resolution (HF `GGUF_CONFIG_MAPPING`
  fallback to standard GGUF keys).
- GGUF → HF tensor name mapping for 8 architecture families (Llama,
  Gemma, Phi3, Falcon, GPT-2, Mamba, MoE variants) with `{bid}`
  block-index expansion.
- Architecture-specific tensor processors: Llama Q/K reverse-permute,
  Gemma/Nemotron norm offset (+1), GPT-2 weight transpose, Mamba
  conv1d unsqueeze + A_log transform.
- `build-gguf` CLI subcommand with `--output`, `--dtype`,
  `--external-data`, and `--keep-quantized` (Phase 2 placeholder) flags.
- `is_known_skip()` for differentiated GGUF tensor logging — separates
  intentionally skipped tensors (tokenizer, rope_freqs) from
  genuinely unmapped ones.
- `gguf` optional dependency group in `pyproject.toml`
  (`pip install mobius-onnx[gguf]`).
- 28 unit tests for GGUF reader, config mapping, tensor mapping,
  tensor processors, and CLI using synthetic GGUF files.

#### Changed

- GGUF tensor mapping cached with `lru_cache` for performance —
  `_build_mapping()` called once per architecture instead of per tensor.
- `_reverse_permute` simplified to single `n_head` parameter.
- `_dequantize_tensor` helper extracted to eliminate duplication between
  `tensor_items()` and `get_tensor()` in reader.

#### Fixed

- `gguf_to_config()` raises `ValueError` for missing critical metadata
  fields (`embedding_length`, `block_count`) instead of silently
  defaulting to hardcoded values.

#### Documentation

- GGUF support proposal (`docs/design/gguf-support-proposal.md`) with
  quantization type catalog, QDQ vs MatMulNBits analysis, and phased
  implementation plan.

### Wave 10 — Other

#### Added

- T5 variant support: gated FFN activation (`T5_GATED_ACT_TO_HF`),
  `scale_decoder_outputs` config field, and integration tests for
  mT5/FLAN-T5/UL2.

#### Changed

- Config Phase 2a: wrapped all config subclass `__init__` methods to
  accept flat `vision_*` kwargs for backward compatibility with nested
  `VisionConfig`.
- Skip `hidden_size / num_attention_heads` divisibility check when
  `head_dim` is explicitly provided in config.

### Sprint 8 Highlights

- **FusedMatMul rewrite rule**: New `Transpose + MatMul → FusedMatMul(transB=1)`
  rule eliminates 197 Transpose nodes per LLM model (every Linear layer).
  CLI `--optimize=all` now registers all 6 rewrite rules (was only 3).
- **Quantization integration tests**: GPTQ and AWQ end-to-end tests with
  synthetic weights verify full pipeline (build → preprocess → apply → ORT
  inference). Found and fixed `_reshape_packed_qzeros` overestimate bug.
- **Mamba2 HF parity**: Integration test with step-by-step numerical
  comparison against HuggingFace. Fixed `GatedRMSNorm` gate ordering
  (SiLU(gate) before normalization).
- **Weight loading fixes**: Consolidated shape mismatch logic into
  `_assign_weight()`, removed dead symbolic-dim guard, fixed Jamba weight
  alignment, cleaned up 48 stale xfails.
- **SSM/T5 correctness**: Bamba/Mamba substring match → `endswith()`,
  T5 logit scaling guard for `tie_word_embeddings`, Mamba2 `head_dim`
  divisibility validation.

### Added

- `FusedMatMul` rewrite rule: fuses `Transpose(weight, [1,0]) + MatMul`
  into `com.microsoft::FusedMatMul(transB=1)` — eliminates one node per
  linear projection (197 fusions in Qwen3-0.6B).
- GPTQ/AWQ end-to-end integration tests with synthetic weights —
  build tiny quantized Llama, preprocess weights, run ORT inference.
- AWQ zero-point offset verification integration test.
- Mamba2 integration test with step-by-step HF parity comparison
  (GatedRMSNorm, Mamba2Block, full model logits).
- All 6 rewrite rules registered in CLI `--optimize` rule map
  (`bias_gelu`, `fused_matmul`, `group_query_attention`,
  `packed_attention`, `skip_layer_norm`, `skip_norm`).

### Fixed

- `GatedRMSNorm` gate ordering: apply `SiLU(gate)` before normalization,
  matching HuggingFace `MambaRMSNormGated`.
- SSM weight rename: greedy substring match (`if param in key`) replaced
  with `key.endswith(param)` in Bamba/Mamba to prevent `.mamba.D` from
  matching `.mamba.Dropout`.
- T5 logit scaling: `hidden_size**-0.5` multiply now guarded by
  `tie_word_embeddings` flag, matching HuggingFace T5 behavior.
- Mamba2 `head_dim` divisibility: `from_transformers()` now raises
  `ValueError` when `d_inner % num_heads != 0`.
- Jamba weight alignment: removed incorrect `model.` prefix stripping
  in `preprocess_weights()`.
- Weight shape mismatch handling consolidated into single
  `_assign_weight()` helper in `_weight_loading.py`.
- Dead symbolic-dim guard removed from `_assign_weight()` — ONNX
  initializers always have concrete integer shapes.
- 48 stale weight alignment test xfails cleaned up (37 genuine remain).
- Mamba2 cache defaults: replaced misleading Bamba-9B-specific values
  (128/64/256) with 0 — configs must provide real values.
- `_reshape_packed_qzeros` overestimated output size when
  `n_groups * bits < 32` — fixed by deriving `n_blocks` from
  `qweight` shape.

### Changed

- Rewrite rules included in default test command (removed
  `--ignore=src/mobius/rewrite_rules`).
- Stale symbolic dim docstring cleaned up in weight loading module.

### Sprint 7 Highlights

- **Quantization support**: `QuantizedLinear` component with `MatMulNBits`,
  `QuantizationConfig`, GPTQ weight preprocessing, and `linear_class`
  injection into all decoder layer projections via `quantized_linear_factory`.
- **New models**: `BambaCausalLMModel` (Mamba2/SSD + Attention hybrid),
  `InternVL2Model` (dedicated VL model with InternViT + pixel shuffle).
- **Auto-export pipeline**: `auto_export()` chains build → apply weights →
  genai_config.json → save → tokenizer copy for ORT-GenAI deployment.
- **Documentation**: Model catalog expanded 26→272 pages via fixed
  `_generate_models.py`; added `docs` optional dependency group.
- **Error diagnostics**: Registry fuzzy matching with `difflib`, `hidden_act`
  guard, weight shape mismatch warnings.
- **Rewrite rules**: SkipLayerNorm bias-free variant for models without LN
  bias; BiasGelu approximate attribute guard for exact Gelu.
- **Test coverage**: 154 new component tests, quantization integration tests,
  generation loop tests, task I/O contract tests.

### Added

  `build()` encounters an unknown `model_type`, heuristically detects
  Llama-like or MoE architectures and routes to the appropriate model
  class. Logs at INFO level when using fallback.

  `rope_type` key.
- Unmapped weight warnings in `ModelPackage.apply_weights()` — logs at
  INFO level for weights not applied (may be tied or unused).

  handling, weight loading).
- `pytest-xdist` for parallel test execution (`pytest -n auto`).
- Reference examples table in adding-a-new-model skill documentation.
- 23 unit tests for Seq2Seq, Denoising, and VAE tasks (I/O contracts,
  KV cache naming, input dtypes, ModelPackage structure).
- `MambaCausalLMModel` and `SSMCausalLMTask` for Mamba selective state
  space models — embedding → N×(MambaBlock + RMSNorm) → logits with
  conv_state + ssm_state carry (no attention mask or KV cache).
- Integration tests for Whisper encoder-decoder (`openai/whisper-tiny`)
  and Gemma3 multimodal 3-model split (tiny config, no download).
  Added `whisper-tiny` and `test_gemma3_multimodal` to CI `-k` filter.
- `Blip2Model` vision-language model with Q-Former bridge — ViT encoder
  → Q-Former cross-attention → language model, using 3-model split
  (decoder, vision encoder, embedding).
- Qwen3.5-VL integration tests: random-weight 3-model VL pipeline test
  and DeltaNet state carry test verifying conv_state/recurrent_state
  update across consecutive decode steps.

  (Llama, Qwen2, Phi3, Gemma2, Mistral) — random-weight models with
  5-step autoregressive decode verifying KV cache growth and finite
  logits.
- Graph construction benchmarks for 10 representative models with
  regression guard (`MAX_BUILD_TIME_SECONDS` threshold).
- `JambaCausalLMModel` hybrid SSM+Attention model with MoE support —
  interleaved Mamba SSM and Transformer attention layers with optional
  Mixture-of-Experts FFN, per-layer conv_state/ssm_state carry, and
  dt/B/C LayerNorm in SSM projections.
- `CogVideoX3DTransformer2DModel` 3D video diffusion transformer with
  temporal attention, 3D positional embeddings, and expert-block
  adaptive LayerNorm.
- FalconMamba registration as alias for `MambaCausalLMModel`.
- `SkipLayerNormalization` rewrite rule: fuses Add + LayerNormalization
  into `com.microsoft::SkipLayerNormalization` for GPT-2/BERT-style
  models (24/25 fusions in GPT-2).
- `BiasGelu` rewrite rule: fuses Add + Gelu into
  `com.microsoft::BiasGelu` for FFN bias+activation (12 fusions in
  GPT-2). Includes `approximate` attribute guard to skip exact Gelu.

  2 inputs (no bias) in addition to the 3-input pattern.
- ORT-GenAI integration module (`integrations/ort_genai/`) with
  `GenaiConfigGenerator` for genai_config.json generation.
- `scaffold` CLI command for generating new model boilerplate files

  State Space Duality) architecture.
- Registry fuzzy matching: unknown `model_type` now suggests closest
  matches via `difflib.get_close_matches` instead of dumping all 271+
  registered types.
- 154 unit tests for 10 previously untested components (Attention, MLP,
  DecoderLayer, Encoder, Conv, LoRA, Whisper, GatedDeltaNet, Scan
  utilities).
- Sphinx documentation site with auto-generated model catalog (272
  model pages from registry metadata). Added `docs` optional dependency
  group to `pyproject.toml`.
- `hidden_act=None` guard in `get_activation()` with descriptive error
  message listing valid activation functions.
- Weight shape mismatch warnings in `apply_weights()` — logs
  expected vs actual shape for debugging.

### Removed

- Dead `_rename_gpt2_weight()` function in `gpt2.py` — unreferenced
  since weight name alignment refactor.

- `SUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURES` allowlist in `_configs.py` — was blocking
  42–66 model types that were registered but not in the allowlist.

### Changed

- Refactored `falcon.py`, `phi3.py`, `phi.py` to use shared weight
  utils instead of inline QKV splitting.
- Aligned module attribute names to HuggingFace weight conventions for
  Falcon, GPT-2, ModernBERT, InternLM, and BERT, eliminating 30+
  `preprocess_weights` renames.
- Added module docstrings and HF class references to top 10 model files
  (Llama, Qwen2, Phi-3, Gemma, Mistral, DeepSeek, BERT, GPT-2, Falcon,
  Phi).
- Config Phase 0a: extracted `_extract_rope_config`,
  `_extract_vision_config`, `_extract_audio_config` helpers from
  `from_transformers()` monolith.
- Unmapped weights logged at INFO level (not WARNING) to reduce noise
  for models with tied embeddings.
- Enhanced 4 TODO comments with category tags and implementation context.
- Fixed TTS task layer violation: removed model import, use direct
  config access.
- Extracted shared diffusion components (`AdaLayerNormZero`,
  `TimestepEmbedding`, `PatchEmbed`, `DiffusionFFN`) from `dit.py` into
  `components/_diffusion.py`; updated `dit.py`, `flux_sd3.py`, and
  `hunyuan_dit.py` to use shared imports.
- Replaced bare `except Exception` with specific exception types
  (`OSError`, `ValueError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`) and added DEBUG-level
  logging in `_config_resolver.py`, `_diffusers_builder.py`, and
  `__main__.py`.
- Added dependency lower bounds: `onnxscript>=0.6.0`, `onnx_ir>=0.1.0`,
  `numpy>=1.24.0`, `torch>=2.10.0`.
- Lazy-import heavy dependencies (`torch`, `transformers`,
  `safetensors.torch`) in CLI for faster `list`/`info` subcommands.
- Mllama cross-attention K/V now cached after first computation in
  `MllamaVisionLanguageTask` decoder, avoiding redundant recomputation
  during decode steps.
- Config Phase 2: migrated all flat `vision_*` fields to nested
  `config.vision.*` accessors across production code (models and tasks).
  Backward compatibility maintained via `__post_init__` bidirectional
  sync.

### Fixed

- Tautological assertion in diffusers builder tests (always-True →
  meaningful `assert_called_once`).
- Temp file leak in `examples/diffusion.py` VAE test — replaced
  `NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)` with `mkdtemp` + `try/finally`
  cleanup.
- RWKV SSM models now rejected in auto-fallback registry instead of
  silently producing incorrect graphs.
- Mamba SSM weight path mapping: `preprocess_weights()` now correctly
  maps flat HF mixer params (`.mixer.A_log`, `.mixer.D`, etc.) to
  nested ONNX params (`.mixer.ssm.A_log`, `.mixer.ssm.D`). Without
  this fix, all SSM params were silently dropped during weight loading.
- `MambaConfig.from_transformers()` handles `intermediate_size=0`
  (falls back to `hidden_size * expand`) and `time_step_rank="auto"`
  (resolves to `ceil(hidden_size / 16)`).
- bfloat16 conversion in test `_fill_random_weights`: uses upper-16-bit
  truncation of float32 instead of broken `.view(np.uint16)` that
  doubled the last dimension.
- Python keyword validation in `scaffold` CLI: rejects reserved words
  like `for`, `class`, `import` that pass regex but create unimportable
  module files.
- TOCTOU race in scaffold file writing: replaced `os.path.exists()` +
  `open("w")` with atomic `open("x")`.
- ORT-GenAI VLM decoder input detection and required `image_token_id`
  field.
- T5 encoder weight mapping: `layer.1.layer_norm` → `ffn_norm`.
- `JambaConfig` duplicate `num_experts` field removed.
- Cross-attention KV cache recomputation in encoder-decoder models:
  `EncoderDecoderAttention` and `WhisperAttention` now properly cache
  cross-attention K/V from the first decode step instead of
  recomputing every step.
- `BiasGelu` rewrite rule now only matches `Gelu(approximate='tanh')`;
  exact Gelu (`approximate='none'`) is no longer incorrectly fused.
- `QuantizedLinear` rejects `block_size < 16` per ORT MatMulNBits spec
  (was only checking positive power-of-2).
- `SkipLayerNormalization` rewrite rule handles bias-free
  LayerNormalization nodes (2-input pattern).
- `auto_export` no longer excludes valid `image_token_id=0`; VLM
  detection tightened to require both `vision` and `embedding` keys.
- `auto_export` guards `pkg.config` access with descriptive error for
  unsupported diffusion models.
- `InternVL2Model` raises `ValueError` when `image_token_id` is None
  instead of silently defaulting to 0.
- Sphinx model catalog generator (`_generate_models.py`) produces pages
  for all 272 registered model types (was only generating 26 due to
  `ModelRegistration` API change).
